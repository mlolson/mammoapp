<h1>About Mammoapp</h1>
<p>
Mammoapp is a teaching tool/game that attempts to mimic a mammogram batch reading session in your
web browser. A teacher or institution can upload mammogram teaching sets and mark findings
using the simple web viewer tool. These findings include information about the
location, type, and description of the lesion. An impression for the mammogram
is also entered, as are indications and final pathology if known. (Note: these parameters are
subject to change, and suggestions are welcome.)
</p>
<p>
Another user can then "read" the set. The goal is to correctly identify as many 
"answer" findings as possible using the web viewer tools. Once the user submits their findings, feedback is 
immediately shown. 
</p>
<p>
Mammoapp is currently in preliminary beta release. Feedback, comments, bug reports, and suggestions are welcome:

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Mammoapp is a game that attempts to mimic a mammogram batch reading session in your
web browser. The goal is to locate and correctly identify as many "correct" findings as possible
using the web viewer tools. **Note however, that the "correct" findings in
the example set are for software testing purposes only, they almost certainly not correct!**

The beta version allows you to "play" one test set of five mammo cases. In the future I hope to make 
it possible to upload your own training sets and mark your own findings.
</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
Two views of each mammogram are available: the user can switch between the
mediolateral-oblique view (MLO) and the chest compression view (CC) by 
clicking the orientation boxes on the right. (Pink arrow). You can also move 
the window around the image by clicking and dragging in the orientation boxes.
</p>
<p>
The canvas is zoomed in and out using the mouse wheel or, alternatively, using the
two buttons in the upper right corner may be user (Blue arrow).
</p>
<h2>Marking Findings</h2>
<p>
To mark a finding, you may use one of the Region of Interest (ROI) tools (Red Arrow). 
To make a rectangle ROI, click the "Rect ROI" button, click on the canvas, and drag. 
To define a polygon ROI, click the "Poly ROI" button, click on the canvas to mark 
your starting point, then continue marking points around the ROI. Close the ROI by 
clicking on your starting point.
</p>
<p>
Once you complete an ROI, you will be asked to provide information about the finding. 
Fill out the description and mark the type, then click "Save & Close". You may select 
an existing finding by clicking on its label. This will bring up the dialog box, 
allowing you to alter or delete it. 
</p>
<h2>Entering an Impression</h2>
<p>
To finish a case, click the "Show Impression" button. This will bring up a dialog
showing a list of all your findings, plus a place to mark a BIRADS category, impression,
indications, and final pathology. When you are finished press "Save & Submit".
</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>
In this beta version the software scores you only on whether you correctly located the findings.<br><br>
